After reading ["We who spoke LOLcat now speak Doge"](https://io9.gizmodo.com/we-who-spoke-lolcat-now-speak-doge-1481243678), I was reminded of how natural playing with language is, especially in regards to humor. It's fascinating how native speakers of a language can recognize and disrupt grammatical rules, naturalistic patterns, and so on without necessarily learning these consciously. Similarly, internet memes and slang are a prime example of the flexibility of human language and the ability of humans to pick up new patterns in context simply by being exposed to them for a while.

As for _Flat Logics_, my main takeaway was actually what to take into consideration when critiquing a piece of digital artwork. This is, perhaps, missing the main point of the essay, but it drove home the idea that when looking at a piece, we cannot look at it in isolation. We must take it and look at it in context of its medium--in this case, the internet itself--and gain more insight into the artist's motivations.

I found _My Mother Was A Computer_ a thought-provoking read. It brought up concepts I had never considered before--for example, that translating between media is comparable to translating between languages or editing texts, and that works can be thought as clusters of related texts. The idea of Work as Assemblage expecially intrigued me, as it seems like an uncommon yet powerful way to think about works, both in criticizing them and in creating them. Considering works through the lens of the fractal, variable nature of media, to me, sounds very freeing.
