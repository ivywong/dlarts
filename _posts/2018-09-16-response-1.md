Language itself is similar to digital media in that it can be described according to the principles of new media as described by Manovich. Language itself is modular; sentences are made up of words, which are made up of morphemes, and so on. The modularity of language allows for its variability; that is, though the parts of a language may be finite, the words and phrases can be combined in a myriad ways to create an infinite number of possible utterances. Finally, language can be described in the two layers detailed in "transcoding" as well: the "cultural layer" involves the semantics of the language, what each utterance means, whereas the "computer layer" would be the grammar, structure, and building blocks used to represent the language. The different "formats" of language would then be, say, spoken vs written vs signed, and so on. 

[Prothesis](https://soundcloud.com/ihatch/sets/prosthesis) and [LONG RONG SONG](https://vimeo.com/143451232) engage with the modularity of language and words; how they can be broken down into tiny parts and built back up again slightly differently. [The Listeners](http://programmatology.shadoof.net/?thelisteners), on the other hand, uses the modularity of Alexa's question-response capability to create something variable. Each "performance" of The Listeners will vary depending on the user's input, what they decide to ask Alexa, and this exemplifies the fluid nature of digital media.
