When I played with [bot or not](http://botpoet.com/), I was surprised by some of the computer generated poems, which I had assumed were written by a human. Some poems were very obviously computer generated, as they didn't make sense, or had a lack of flow, but others were rather coherent. I wonder if there is a way to tell with a reasonable amount of certainty if a poem is computer generated? "Nonsensical" might be a clue, but there are also poets like e.e. cummings who play with ungrammatical verse. And since some of these generators are trained on human-written poetry, it's difficult to tell whether a poem is generated based on something written by a human, or is actually written by a human.

I found _Digital Oulipo_ an interesting read. I did not expect generative literature to have been attempted so early in the time of computers--and so late in the course of human history. Even if computers did not exist at the time, surely someone would have come up with a form of algorithmic art? I also thought it interesting how the Oulipo wanted to reduce in their works, because when I think of generative literature, I think of randomness. Then again, if generators were truly random, then we wouldn't get gems like [_Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash_](http://botnik.org/content/harry-potter.html), would we?
