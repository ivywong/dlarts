J. R. Carpenter's [A Handmade Web](http://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html), to me, puts into words a certain aesthetic that I've noticed while exploring the web and running into personal websites of people from older communities (writing, art, and so on), which calls back to a time when the Internet was smaller, slower, and more intimate. There's just something more _personal_ about creating your own website page by page, deciding on every aspect of how it looks and feels yourself, rather than going on to Wordpress (or other site), finding a template that just kind of works, with a bunch of bulky features you'll never use, distracting yourself from the content that you wanted to show off in the first place.
