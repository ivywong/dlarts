My experiment for this week is [DRINK ME]({{site.baseurl}}/experiments/drink-me/play.html), a very short interactive fiction game inspired (very loosely) by _Alice in Wonderland_ and other strange fiction.

In case you haven't played IF games before, here are a few commands to start with:

- `look` or `l`: look around the room
- `examine (something)` or `x (something)`: look at an object closely
- `north`,`south`, `east`, `west`: cardinal directions (movement)
- `take`: take something
- `drop`: drop something
- `inventory` or `i`: check what you're carrying

If you get stuck, here's [a spoiler-free walkthrough]({{site.baseurl}}/experiments/drink-me/walkthrough.txt):
