After thinking about it some more, I'm debating whether I should make the person behind the website an actual alien. It would be a cool opportunity to explore really weird sci-fi stuff, but that might be too much to do in the limited amount of time I have.

This week, I hashed out some of the language and culture specifics and came up with this story, or _shiwud_, a fable-esque story tradition teaching about relationships. In-universe, the website owner likes to write in their free time and was asked to write this for a friend's child. I really like how it turned out, in that the meaning of the machine translated part is drastically different from the manual translation. I'm not sure if I managed to get the feeling of the machine translation out properly, though.

The point here is that in this culture, everyone who isn't a stranger -- yes, even your enemies -- is considered a "friend", or perhaps comrade, but there are different shades of the word, representing different relationship dynamics. 

In any case, I'm feeling a bit behind; I've been swamped with work recently. At the very least, I'm hoping I can get a few of these types of stories and a few snippets up for a homepage by the presentation next week. I'm not sure I can get this drastic of a contrast between both translations for other pieces of writing, hm... Well, the good thing about making up a language is that you can make up the things that trip people up, too.

## shiwud - re'yir, re'yan (poor friend, good friend)

### Original

yuud ti, pamam e ti Patur. re'yan Patur ti Asya, lon tu'ip. reko nubin reko nubin lon erto re. tse! nutwe shas Patur Asya, lon erto Asya ti Henor. huyuy Patur rinsu, huyuy Patur palef, minti nuo e ti, ti Asya. nim Patur -- re'yir! re'yir! fa ge' Patur shironta ran, ge' ti pagur manho, fa lanelane erto ti.

tse! reko erto erto, bonhim Patur nuo e ti, bonhim huyyar manho, mintiye ti. huyuy Patur rinsu, huyuy Patur rinsu. Rinsu, rinsu, lane, lane. re'yir Asya, shas Asya Patur, ne Asya Patur manho, kumo Asya nuo e ti. nim Asya -- re'yan piy Patur, re'yir Patur piy.  

fa shasye Patur. tio Asya.

nim Patur -- re'yir piy rom, re'yan rom piy.

### Machine Translation

He exists, his name Patur. Friend Patur he Asya, both same. During storm during storm both they play. Ah! One day, Patur sees Asya, both Asya he Henor plays. Patur tastes salt, Patur tastes iron, breaks his toy, he Asya. Patur says -- Friend! Friend! Then Patur runs angrily with, he runs to away, then alone he plays.

Ah! During play play, Patur drops his toy, drops to ground, he breaks. Patur tastes salt, Patur tastes salt. Salt, salt, one, one. Friend Asya, Asya sees Patur, Asya comes to Patur, Asya fixes his toy. Asya says -- friend I Patur, friend Patur I.

Then Patur looks. Honest Asya.

Patur says -- friend I you, friend you I.

### Manual Translation

There once was a boy named Patur. Patur and Asya were good friends. They would play together all day and night. But one day, Patur saw Asya playing with Henor. Patur became jealous and broke Asya's toy. Poor friend! he said. Poor friend! And he stomped off to play with his toys alone.

But while playing, Patur dropped his toy onto the ground. It broke. Patur became sad. Sad and alone. Poor friend Asya saw him and came over and fixed his toy. Asya said, "You are a poor friend to me, but I am a good friend to you."

And Patur looked, and it was true.

Patur said, "I am a poor friend to you, and you are a good friend to me."
