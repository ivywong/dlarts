After looking into my previous final project idea some more, I realized that there are some serious technical difficulties involved with it, and might be too big in scale to be completed in two weeks. I've edited [the previous post]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-11-22-final-project-proposal-updated %}) with my findings, and here's my final proposal. The last version, I promise!

**Working Title**: An Open Window

**Summary**: 

Standalone site. A "personal" site, calling back to the handmade web, containing diary entries and poems, in a language incomprehensible. 

You, the reader, are trying to take this and understand it, but using google translate gives you a strange-yet-sort-of-comprehensible version of the site, but the phrases used and the "machine" translation loses the personal touch and coherence of the entries.

You, the reader, decide to delve deeper. The "Translate" button disappears after translating. Hovering over text starts a "manual" translation process where the text transitions slowly to a more "genuine" translation, one where the feeling-meaning of the original text shines through.

**Concept**:

Here, I want to explore the idea of language as communication, and how language and culture are intertwined, and how machine translation is ultimately limited in this case. I also want to explore concepts of translation -- how one cannot simply translate word for word, because texts are not simply chains of words, but have multiple levels: word, sentence, paragraph, and textual.

The difference between the machine translation and the genuine translation will be the retention of feeling, as well as cultural gaps -- perhaps the machine translation uses technically-correct-but-oddly-formal words, or translates some idioms literally rather than finding a similar English phrase.

To showcase this, the website will contain a few (4-5) journal entries, some short poems, and possibly a few odds and ends depending on time constraints.

The main challenge lies in creating all the content for this project. I worldbuild for fun and have dabbled in constructed languages ("conlanging") before, so if I want to make the incomprehensible language actually grammatically consistent, it shouldn't be too difficult. Vocabulary can come from [Vulgar](https://www.vulgarlang.com/), a language generator. So, the sticking point is making a distinct enough culture through these bits and pieces of writing such that a machine generator would have trouble translating them, and such that I can hold the reader's attention via cultural differences.

One question I have yet to answer is how to impress on the reader that the "genuine" translation is an effortful process. Hovering over each and every paragraph is good and all, but it still may be a little too "easy". I'm also not sure whether I should try to introduce some complex cultural elements that would require, say, footnotes to understand properly. 

Some other options are to have a dictionary or wiki in an external sidebar of sorts, so the reader would have to look up words or concepts themselves, rather than relying on an automated process. This might be an interesting path to go down (the reader is a "researcher" or "investigator" of sorts) but would require more work on the technical side, and I think I'll focus more on creating the content first.
