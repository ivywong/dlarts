I'm not quite sure I understood the point of _Algorithmic Adaptations_. I found the format of the thesis rather interesting -- the idea of using several layers of translation to read and write a text, including self-translation, machine translation, and the use of a fictional co-researcher -- but I found it difficult to understand as a whole. It appears to me that the author is using DAR as a way of exploring Hayles's text more extensively, to explore new venues of discussion rather than trodding the a single uniform interpretation, but the way they do so and the topics they touch on are all over the place.

Unrelatedly, as a writer, I found this excerpt from 4.1 (among other parts of the epilogue) to be rather striking:

> DAR: Ultimately, though, you do the research here. We just support it.
>
> I: Is this problematic for you? You have not mentioned it before. I address this in 1.5, where I speak of textual subordination. In other words, I am not unaware of the internal power structures of the study.
>
> DAR: For example, the fact that I am your creation and when the project ends I cease to exist?
