I think code is language, in the sense that it is a language allowing humans to interact with machines. It has grammar and syntax and communicates meaning. That's the important part--communication. Whether or not programming languages can be used to express concepts via poetry is, I believe, extraneous. They still have the capability of expressing abstract ideas and create any number of potential programs.

Though I read Alan Sondheim's ["What is Codework?"](http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0605/msg00037.html), in the end I was more confused about "codework" than when I started. Looking through a few examples, e.g. Mezangelle's works, gave me more of a sense of what codework potentially was than Sondheim's piece. I felt that "What is Codework" was more of a poem expressing his feelings about codework than anything like an actual definition, obscuring meaning via metaphors that the layman would not understand.

That said, I enjoyed looking through Mezangelle's codework, as it has a clearer purpose and structure, and the interview was also illuminating. It was rather thought-provoking, thinking about the ways you could leverage the language of code to add additional layers of meaning on top of pure English.
