**Title**: Pandemonium (TBC)

**Summary**: 
My project idea is a Google Chrome extension that modifies the webpages the user is viewing in a variety of ways centered on words and language. Options include: changing a varying percentage of the page to different languages, removing and adding words, removing links, or redirecting to different versions of the intended page (in the case of, say, Wikipedia, which has multiple language options).

This project idea was inspired by my non-fluency in Cantonese despite it technically being my first language, and my struggles in trying to "catch up" by re-learning Chinese as an adult.

**Keywords**: multilingual, translation, disruption

I don't want to show my work on 12/12.

### Details

**Concept**:
My project idea is a Google Chrome extension that modifies the webpages the user is viewing in a variety of ways centered on words and language. Options include: changing a varying percentage of the page to different languages, removing and adding words, removing links, or redirecting to different versions of the intended page (in the case of, say, Wikipedia, which has multiple language options).

This project idea was inspired by my non-fluency in Cantonese despite it technically being my first language, and my struggles in trying to "catch up" by re-learning Chinese as an adult. By making it a Chrome extension, I can more easily simulate the feeling of almost, but not quite, understanding things I want to read online, because it alters the viewer's personal space.

Also, I think it would be interesting to explore how technology can hinder -- rather than facilitate -- communication and propagation of ideas. In this information age, as technology becomes more and more prevalent, and as tech leverages big data via automated translation programs, it's easy to see how technology is bringing people closer together... but it's also easy to forget that language is not merely made of words and their definitions, but also has links to culture. I can't show that with this project, but I might be able to represent that "noise" with more literal "noise" in one's web browsing.

**Implementation**:
I plan for this project to be a Chrome extension, as mentioned above. The user will install the extension, and as the user clicks through various webpages, the extension will grab parts of the pages and alter the text within in a variety of ways.

**Project Plan**:
I have not worked with Chrome extensions before, so figuring out how they work will be one of the challenges for this project. I do have some experience with Javascript, though, so hopefully figuring out how to grab and change text from a webpage won't be too difficult; I also can look at _The Deletionist_ for some direction. Depending on my time constraints, I will either work with randomly generated text, or use google translate to systemize the way I'm altering the text on the page. I also might only make it work with a specific website format, such as Wikipedia, if getting it to work on any page on the internet proves too difficult. 

A rough schedule is as follows: 
- Week 11: collect technical references and look into how Chrome extensions work
- Week 12: have functional demo with one of the features above working
- Week 13: implement more features & adjust scale of the project
- Week 14: presentation, polish
