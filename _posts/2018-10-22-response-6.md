Upon reading ["Data Will Help Us"](http://datawillhelp.us/), though I don't agree with all the questions in the manifesto, I agree with its main point--though data has great potential to help us, it isn't the only answer to humanity's progress--we still have a long way to go, and we have to be careful not to let data blind us. In that vein, I especially liked "It will help us uncover the facts, but will it help us be wise?"

I also found Lev Manovich's _Cultural Data_ to be interesting; I hadn't thought about how data in itself could be biased one way or another as well, and about the limitations of sampling. Manovich's argument is reasonable; though the internet appears global, it is still biased towards those who have access to it, and though there is so much data available right now, the way we sample from this data has a great impact on what we discover about it.

Data is a great resource, but using it comes with a variety of ethical concerns. We can use it to learn more about the world, but we also have to take care not to draw the wrong conclusions and take them as truth, and we need to remember that data comes from real people like you and me.
