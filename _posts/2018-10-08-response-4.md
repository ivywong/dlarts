If the same text (from 3D text) is represented in a 2D format, it would not be the same work. Texts in 3D often have another dimensionality to it -- a sense of the reader or viewer traversing through the text, rather than just reading it. Text in 2D, whether in print or on a flat screen, lack this immersion, which is integral to the work itself. Walking in a forest is not the same as looking at a picture of the forest or clicking through a panorama of it.

Some keywords:
- motion (of the text)
- motion (of the viewer)
- depth (z axis)
- the text's surroundings
- the viewer's surroundings
- physical (or virtual) interactivity with the viewer
- the shape of the text
- the size of the text in relation to the viewer
- number of possible viewpoints
- immersion

I couldn't think of any "text in 3D" examples off the top of my mind, so I looked at [Snirps by Jhave](http://glia.ca/2017/ar/glia/ar/snirps-up/). Unfortunately, I don't have a VR device, so mouse-movement will have to do. There's quite a lot going on in this work, and I would first approach it by just looking around, observing my surroundings (in this case, a tube of text, in which I am rising) and taking a closer look at the text itself. I see that the text is arranged not only in a tube, but in blobs. I as the viewer have little control over my own movement; I can move sideways, but my vertical position in relation to the tube is always changing. The size of the work in comparison to the viewer is massive; it feels as if the viewer is in an expansive space.

If you were to strip out the text and present it in 2D format, you might be able to replicate some of these aspects, such as the shape of the text and the constant movement, but it would be extremely restrictive and lacking compared to 3D space. It would be an almost entirely different experience.
